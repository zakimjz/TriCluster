# TriCluster 3D gene expression clustering algorithm

Tricluster is the first tri-clustering algorithm for microarray expression clustering. It builds upon our microCluster bi-clustering approach. Tricluster first mines all the bi-clusters across the gene-sample slices, and then it extends these into tri-clusters across time or space (depending on the third dimension). It can find both scaling and shifting patterns.
